# nosql-challenge
This repository is for the edX Bootcamp affiliated with CWRU on Data Visualization, for module 12 - NoSQL.

In this assignemnt, I first imported the establishments.json file (found in the Resources folder of this repository) using PyMongo and created a database called uk_food to work from. I used the provided starter code and skills developed during class time to set up the database, update it with new information, make queries, remove unwanted documents, and set certain fields to the desired datatypes. That was all done in the first notebook "NoSQL_setup_MH.ipynb."

The next part of the assignment was done in the notebook "NoSQL_analysis_MH." In this file I used the starter code and skills developed in class to answer analysis questions - creating queries and dataframes to answer the provided question. On question 3, I worked with my Bootcamp classmate Steven Anthony.

This repository shows the capability I have to work in pymongo.
